For full details on the [mods I've mentioned](./custom-build-description.md) the best thing to do is to visit their Github project pages. Here are links to each of them:

* [Springy](https://github.com/moggieuk/ERCF-Springy)

For some of these mods I've taken some time to provide additional information and thought it would be useful to share here

# Triple-Decky
This is a popular mod for the SturdyBunny. A lot of people have had great success with this mod that replaces the ***filament blocks*** found in SturdyBunny/ERCF.
It has gone through several revisions and continues to improve with each one. Also the designer of Triple-Decky frequents the Voron `#ercf_questions` channel.

> Note: One thing to note about this mod, the filament blocks are 23.05mm wide compared to the original 21mm blocks in SturdyBunny. So this means if you are using a kit where the linear rods and the D-Shaft have already been cut to work with the 21mm blocks, that they may end up being shorter than you might feel comfortable with. If your kit was a 9 port/gate/channel version, you'll likely leave out a block leaving on 8.

## Assembly video of Triple-Decky filament blocks
Yes...I put together a video that describes how I clean up the printed parts and assemble them.

# Thumper Blocks
I just learned about a new filament blocks option today (11/10/2023) and asked about it in the following [Voron discord server post](https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/909743915475816458/1172586794240458848). The designer of Thumper Blocks responded quickly and even pushed up a new revision (Rev_2) for me to try out.

I've done some initial test prints and am really liking this design and think it might be an excellent option. I've already printed a bunch of Triple-Decky filament blocks but I think this Thumper Blocks design should be looked at as it has some really good design points:

* Base and Filament Path parts do not need supports
  * My initial test prints of the Rev_1 pieces turned out great
* The "brake" uses a more readily available M4 nut 
* The blocks are thinner so the original ERCF hardware (rods, etc) can be used

> Note: A major *plus* about this design is that if you're using pre-cut linear rods and D-shaft (say from a kit), you can keep the number of gates that the kit was designed for without having to *possibly* lose one if you had gone with the wider Triple-Decky blocks.

More details about these Thumper Blocks differences can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/kieraneglin/Thumper-Blocks#differences-compared-to-triple-decky)


I've also made a video about these filament blocks

I'll update this section of the site after I get a chance to more fully evaluate this option. But so far I'm optimistic. It prints so much easier as it has no supports (except the tophat which is easy to remove) and the fitment of the parts that I'm getting from my printer seems to be just right. I like that I can use my existing hardware without having to lose a gate/port (as Triple-Decky is wider so you *may* lose a port....I do not know this for sure but I think that's the case).

# Springy Selector Mod Video
I took some video of my experience preparing and test fitting the Springy parts and found some time to edit/cut a video that I pushed up to YouTube
