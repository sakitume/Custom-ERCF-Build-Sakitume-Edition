You will want to reference the original [ERCF v1.1 Build Manual](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/blob/main/Documentation/ERCF_Manual.pdf)

I have lots of pictures and raw video footage of when I assembled my ERCF. I hope to make some time to edit something 
together and post up to YouTube. Here are some scattered notes for now.


## 2020 extrusion
SturdyBunny requires a length of 2020 extrusion. The exact length depends on the number of gates you want
as well as the type of filament blocks you'll be using (Triple-Decky or Thumper Blocks).

### If using Thumper Blocks
I have a 6 gate ERCF kit. I cut my extrusion to 175mm. This allows me to fully swing open the upper part of the assembly to about 105 degrees.
So....a forumula could be derived like this:

```
(NumberOfGates * 21) + 49
```

A 9 gate build would probably be around 238mm; I'd round that up to an even 240mm. ***This is just an estimation***


### If using Triple-Decky
If using Triple-Decky then reference [this post from the designer of Triple-Decky](https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/909743915475816458/1152197493937934446).

It basically says this about the extrusion:
```
Length of 2020 extrusion = 54.6 + (N x 23.05) Note that the extrusion can go past the block end without problem.
```

I've also heard several times on the Voron discord server that 7 1/4" (184mm) is a good length for a 6 gate build
See [this post on the Voron discord server](https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/909743915475816458/1172548137211142154)


## The gearbox assembly
Reference the original [ERCF Build Manual](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/blob/main/Documentation/ERCF_Manual.pdf) to figure out what heat set inserts you'll install. There are only a few differences between SturdyBunny and original ERCF v1.1

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Be sure to route the endstop switch wires and your gear motor wires into the correct area during this part of the assembly or you will not be able to install the bottom plate later on. I didn't realize this the first time I assembled the gearbox so I want you to avoid the headache of having to disassemble and fix later on. I need to put some pictures up about this here!!!

If you're reading this and you're building it *right now* and this isn't clear then feel free to message me on the Delayed Discord server (use search box of this site for a link in case you're not already a member of that server).


## Servo arm
You will need to wait until you have Happy Hare installed before you can install the servo arm. This is because you want to set the servo into position (either up or down) so you can align the arm to match that position.
