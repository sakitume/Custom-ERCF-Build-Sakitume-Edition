# Overview
This is a set of notes on how I'm building my custom ERCF (Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder). In many ways this custom build is likely to be similar to what the (as yet to be released) ERCF v2 will be.

Figuring out how to make this custom build can be a bit daunting since there are so many different pieces to it. Thankfully I did not have to figure this all out on my own.
I was able to search the internet and come across various resources and posts from some awesome people. I think what I've come up with (so far) is pretty good, so I thought I'd take notes and also share them with others (as well as future me who forgets things).

Please check out the sidebar on the left (pull it down if you have to in case it is collapsed) and browse the various sections I've compiled thus far.

> Note: This isn't meant to be a build guide, although it should contain enough information to help with most builds. Instead it is a collection of notes and information that I collected while building *my* ERCF, using a FYSETC kit and a selection of mods that I thought made sense. So please be mindful that there can be some mistakes or inefficiencies in how I built mine. Also some of what I've done might not apply to your own build especially when different parts or mods are used.

Oh...and thanks for visiting.
