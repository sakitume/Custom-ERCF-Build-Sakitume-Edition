You will want to reference the original [ERCF v1.1 Build Manual](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/blob/main/Documentation/ERCF_Manual.pdf)

I have lots of pictures and raw video footage of when I assembled my ERCF. I hope to make some time to edit something 
together and post up to YouTube. 


I'll throw up some basic stuff for now

## 2020 extrusion
SturdyBunny requires a length of 2020 extrusion. The exact length depends on the number of gates you want
as well as the type of filament blocks you'll be using (Triple-Decky or Thumper Blocks).

### If using Thumper Blocks
I have a 6 gate ERCF kit. I cut my extrusion to 175mm. This allows me to fully swing open the upper part of the assembly to about 105 degrees.
So....a formula could be derived like this:

```
(NumberOfGates * 21) + 49
```

A 9 gate build would probably be around 238mm; I'd round that up to an even 240mm. ***This is just an estimation***


### If using Triple-Decky
If using Triple-Decky then reference [this post from the designer of Triple-Decky](https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/909743915475816458/1152197493937934446).

It basically says this about the extrusion:
```
Length of 2020 extrusion = 54.6 + (N x 23.05) Note that the extrusion can go past the block end without problem.
```

I've also heard several times on the Voron discord server that 7 1/4" (184mm) is a good length for a 6 gate build
See [this post on the Voron discord server](https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/909743915475816458/1172548137211142154)

## Heatset inserts
Reference the manual, you'll need to be able to install heatset inserts into a variety of different parts. The manual
provides a link to a tutorial in case you aren't already familiar with this process
