
## The gearbox assembly
Reference the original [ERCF Build Manual](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/blob/main/Documentation/ERCF_Manual.pdf) to figure out what heat set inserts you'll install. There are only a few differences between SturdyBunny and original ERCF v1.1

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Be sure to route the endstop switch wires and your gear motor wires into the correct area during this part of the assembly or you will not be able to install the bottom plate later on. I didn't realize this the first time I assembled the gearbox so I want you to avoid the headache of having to disassemble and fix later on. I need to put some pictures up about this here!!!

If you're reading this and you're building it *right now* and this isn't clear then feel free to message me on the Delayed Discord server (use search box of this site for a link in case you're not already a member of that server).

## Heatset Inserts
TODO, place pics and describe the locations. Verify that the two inserts I missed during my build are actually on the backside of the other part. Use CAD to verify and take a screenshot of that so we can include it with the other pics.



## Another Video
I was able to make some time to cut the raw footage I took while assembling the gearbox and push out another video to YouTube

> Note: The mistake I made with the two screws that act as pins for one of the latches is described here in the video https://youtu.be/fbsh2KR2J1U?t=848
I have not updated the video to describe where the missed heatset inserts should have been placed. Hopefully the notes and pictures I have placed in this guide will help explain what should have been done
