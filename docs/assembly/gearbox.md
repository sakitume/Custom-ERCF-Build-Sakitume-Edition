
## The gearbox assembly
Reference the original [ERCF Build Manual](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/blob/main/Documentation/ERCF_Manual.pdf) to figure out what heat set inserts you'll install. There are only a few differences between SturdyBunny and original ERCF v1.1

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Be sure to route the endstop switch wires and your gear motor wires into the correct area during this part of the assembly or you will not be able to install the bottom plate later on. I didn't realize this the first time I assembled the gearbox so I want you to avoid the headache of having to disassemble and fix later on. I need to put some pictures up about this here!!!

If you're reading this and you're building it *right now* and this isn't clear then feel free to message me on the Delayed Discord server (use search box of this site for a link in case you're not already a member of that server).
