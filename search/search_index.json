In many ways this custom build is likely to be similar to what the (as yet to be released) ERCF v2 will be.</p> <p>Figuring out how to make this custom build can be a bit daunting since there are so many different pieces to it. Thankfully I did not have to figure this all out on my own. I was able to search the internet and come across various resources and posts from some awesome people. I think what I've come up with (so far) is pretty good, so I thought I'd take notes and also share them with others (as well as future me who forgets things).</p> <p>Please check out the sidebar on the left (pull it down if you have to in case it is collapsed) and browse the various sections I've compiled thus far.</p> <p>Oh...and thanks for visiting.</p> <p>--Sakitume (Sock it to me)</p> <p>My ERCF Build Log.

So instead of the original ERCF project, we start with this.<ul> <li>SturdyBunny uses a small length of 2020 extrusion in place of the two 8mm threaded rod of the original ERCF design making this more...uh....sturdy</li> </ul> </li> <li>Springy - A modified selector (the carriage that slides back and forth selecting one port/gate over another)</li> <li>Triple-Decky - These are improved filament blocks that are very popular and well established</li> <li>Binky - This is an improved encoder, the subsystem that helps figure out how much filament is being pushed/pulled</li> </ul> <p>That's the \"recipe\" that Tea describes and what many people consider to be the \"Community ERCF v2\". It's a fine recipe, however I'm changing things up a little bit with my custom build.</p> <p>Rather than using Triple-Decky I've opted to use Thumper Blocks. And to avoid tip tuning (which I hear is a time consuming and tricky process), I've opted to use a filament cutter. And I'm going to try out the ERCF Filament Cutter</p> <p>More info on these different mods can be found here</p>"},{"location":"sidebar/custom-build-description.html#thats-a-lot-of-ingredients","title":"That's a lot of ingredients","text":"<p>Yeah...to build this custom beast you are going to have to jump around a bunch of different mods/designs. Each one will have a set of <code>.stl</code> files that you need to print. And it isn't very clear which files you actually need and which ones you should skip altogether. Then you have to assemble everything and there isn't going to be an instruction manual for this. </p> <p>But don't worry, while it may seem daunting there are others who have traveled this path (or one similar to it) and that makes it easier. There are several resources available that you can turn to:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>#ercf_questions</code> channel on the Voron Discord Server has a lot of activity with people posting questions (and often answers) regarding ERCF. To be honest, because it can be a bit busy at times, and due to how Discord works, some posts can get lost (scroll away) due to the activity.</li> <li>Matt's Unofficial ERCF v2 Printed Parts Tracker spreadsheet</li> <li>The <code>#ercf_mmu</code> channel on fizzy's 3DPrinting Discord server has some helpful folks. Not as busy as the Voron Discord server, but maybe that's a good thing.</li> <li>My ERCF Build Log on the Delayed Development discord server (invite for this server is [here)</li> </ul> <p>And well....of course there are these notes you're reading now, as well as a few videos on my YouTube channel.</p>"},{"location":"sidebar/the-mods.html","title":"The various mods","text":"<p>For full details on the mods I've mentioned the best thing to do is to visit their Github project pages.
