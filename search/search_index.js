The Happy Hare default values for <code>UP</code> and <code>DOWN</code> position are pretty good but I strongly suggest you test it out and fine tune it. At the very least make sure the values aren't too high or low so that the servo doesn't try to go beyond the range that its physical stopper allows it. Since you've installed the servo arm while the servo was in the <code>UP</code> position hopefully you'll only need to fine tune the <code>DOWN</code> position (if needed).</p> <p>Issue the following command to see how the arm looks when in the <code>DOWN</code> position</p> <pre><code>MMU_SERVO POS=down\n</code></pre> <p>Try toggling back and forth between the two positions to make sure you're happy with everything.

What that angle is depends on which filament block tophat you have (Triple-Decky vs Thumper Blocks) and also your servo choice. I can provide you some general guidelines based on my own experience.</p> <p>If you're using Springy, back off on the tensioner screw all the way. Swing up the upper part of the ERCF so you can easily view the servo. Back off that screw while applying slight pressure to the servo and watch and feel until you know it has reached its upper limit of travel. </p> <p>Note: You can leave it like this for now (and tighten down the tensioner screw as needed when you check for filament slippage.

The example below sets the servo angle to 130.</p> <pre><code>SET_SERVO SERVO=mmu_servo  ANGLE=130\n</code></pre> <p>So the process I used to set the angle was to issue <code>MMU_SERVO POS=down</code> (after selecting a gate of course), then by visually inspecting and/or testing for filament slip I could use <code>SET_SERVO SERVO=mmu_servo  ANGLE=XXX</code> (where <code>XXX</code> is a guess of what I think might work better) to test an angle. Once I found a value that I liked I then edited the value of <code>servo_down_angle</code> in the <code>mmu_parameters.cfg</code> file.</p> <p>You'll try to get what you think is a good feel or compromise.

This is important because this will be the first calibration step that will use the servo and push down on the tophats. So I really think it is important to ensure the servo arm is properly installed and if you're using the Springy mod, properly tensioned.</p> <p>Here is a short writeup on how I setup the servo arm</p> <p>Note: By default Happy Hare configures itself to use \"collision\" method. You can verify this by examining your <code>mmu_parameters.cfg</code> file and looking search for <code>extruder_homing_endstop</code>. While I eventually switched to using the \"touch\" (Stallguard) method I'm keeping my notes for when I used the \"collision\" method.</p> <p>But wait...there's more!

It took me a bit of head scratching and inspecting the Happy Hare logs and Happy Hare source code to figure out that the process it was using to check for when the filament hit the extruder (\"collision\") wasn't working because the run current was too low.  I decided to use <code>0.650</code> and that worked for my particular setup.</p>"},{"location":"sidebar/happy-hare.html#what-mmu_calibrate_bowden-actually-does","title":"What <code>MMU_CALIBRATE_BOWDEN</code> actually does","text":"<p>Okay, if you've addressed those pre-requisites we're almost ready to run the <code>MMU_CALIBRATE_BOWDEN</code> command that I mentioned. But let me describe how it works.  In this example we'll say the bowden tube is about 530mm and we'll execute the following command.</p> <pre><code>MMU_CALIBRATE_BOWDEN BOWDEN_LENGTH=500 \n</code></pre> <p>Happy Hare will spin the gear motor until 500mm of filament have been extended into the bowden tube. Then it will repeatedly push out 3mm of filament, after each push it will see if the filament has moved or if it has collided with the extruder gears. When it detects no movement has occured after a push it concludes that it has collided with the extruder gears and stops trying to push any more filament. It does this three times.</p> <p>Note: During those 3mm steps that it performs, it reduces the run current of the stepper motor. This way when the filament collides with the extruder gears the gear stepper motor can skip steps or the BMG gears slip. I don't know exactly which of these two it is designed to do but I'm hoping the stepper motor skips rather than the BMG gears grinding the filament. </p> <p>Okay. Run that command with a guess of how long your filament is. When you do this watch the filament end through your reverse Bowden tube. Hopefully you'll see it push the filament through tube and stop before it hits the extruder and then it performs those incremental 3mm steps until it hits. If it doesn't stop before the extruder and just rams into it reduce the <code>BOWDEN_LENGTH</code> value. If it stops too soon and then performs those 3mm incremental steps but never reaches the extruder than increase the value of the <code>BOWDEN_LENGTH</code> parameter (or add the <code>HOMING_MAX=100</code> parameter as the default is 50 and 100 or more can be specified).</p> <p>Okay...if all goes well Happy Hare will perform 3 full tests (that you'll see being logged into the console) and then it will compute and save the actual length it detected and this part of your calibration is now done!</p> <p>One last thing </p> <p>You might want to consider tuning the reduced run current I mentioned earlier. The HappyHare docs say you can adjust the current when using \"collision\" method by adjusting the <code>extruder_homing_current</code> parameter in your <code>mmu_parameters.cfg</code> file. Here's what that section looks like:</p> <pre><code>extruder_homing_current: 40     # % gear_stepper current (10%-100%) to use when homing to extruder homing (100 to disable)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"sidebar/happy-hare.html#the-mmulog-can-help-you-diagnose-things","title":"The <code>mmu.log</code> can help you diagnose things","text":"<p>Remember about that <code>run_current</code> setting? The reason I know about it is because I initially did this bowden calibration wrong by trying to work around a weird issue, not recognizing it for what it really was. Here's the story...</p> <p>The main issue I had trying to calibrate the bowden tube length was that Happy Hare was never pushing the filament to the extruder gears unless I overshot by a large amount the guesstimated distance from the ERCF to the extruder. So to make it \"work\" I simply gave it a large value until it hit the extruders and then it was able to detect that the filament had stopped and definitely \"collided\" with the extruder gears. I did not know how HappyHare was supposed to work and thought I just needed to do that. But I recognized later that this just didn't seem right. </p> <p>I re-read the Happy Hare documentation and it is supposed to advance up to <code>extruder_homing_max</code> (which is set to <code>50</code>) as it tries to collide with the extruder. This definitely wasn't happening for me. It would simply say \"sorry...not working\" (not really...but something short and simple was displayed...can't remember what exactly). I then examined the source code and traced it down to the code that performs this advancement. The code will log how many steps it will take and the outcome of each step.

One important thing to keep in mind is the fitment of the \"base\" and \"filament-path\" parts. The upper \"filament-path\" part hinges/pivots against the \"base\" part. If this is not freely pivoting then there are additional versions of these parts that have increased clearance. They can be found in the <code>Clearance_options</code> subfolder:</p> <pre><code>Triple-Decky/STL/Sturdy Bunny/Rev_C/Rev_C7.0_3PS_only/Clearance_options\n  Triple_Decky_Base_C70_clrearance1.stl\n  Triple_Decky_Base_C70_clrearance2.stl\n  Triple_Decky_Filament_path_3PS_C70_clearance1.stl\n  Triple_Decky_Filament_path_3PS_C70_clearance2.stl\n</code></pre> <p>Be sure to check out the video at the bottom of the Triple-Decky README.md</p> <p>I've also put together a video that describes how I clean up these Triple-Decky parts and assemble them. This will also show you the type of smooth and feely pivoting action you should be going for</p> <p></p> <p>Next you need to print out one trap for each port (filament block). They are found in the <code>Traps</code> folder. I chose to use the \"V Shape\" variant:</p> <pre><code>Triple-Decky/STL/Sturdy Bunny/Rev_C/Traps\n  TD_Base_Trap_V-Shape_C56.stl\n</code></pre> <p>There is a setscrew variant. I think the difference is that the setscrew metallic threads impart greater friction against the filament when it is activated as brake. These reportedly work better for some folks compared to the \"v\" shape traps.</p> <p>My understanding is that these traps are simply holes that the filament will pass through. When a filament block is active (enaged by the selector) the path of the filament as it passes through a trap is straight and clear with minimal resistance. If a block is not active then the trap is lifted slightly and the filament is no longer straight through the trap hole and experiences resistance; this helps keep the filament from moving in/out of the block while the block is not active.</p> <p>If you have m3x2 or m3x3 setscrews then you might want to try that set screw variant instead:</p> <pre><code>Triple-Decky/STL/Sturdy Bunny/Rev_C/Traps\n  TD_Base_Trap_M3x3_C55.stl\n</code></pre> <p>The last part you'll need from Triple-Decky is the servo arm.
